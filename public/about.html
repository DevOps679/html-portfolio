<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Bula! I'm Leone Bainivanua, a Fijian islander embracing the Indonesian life with my amazing wife and two daughters.  
  When I'm not chasing after my little ones, you'll find me on the rugby pitch or diving deep into lines of code. 
  I'm a junior web developer with a passion for learning and creating, always eager to tackle new challenges and expand my skillset.  
  I believe in the power of family, the thrill of sport, and the endless possibilities of technology.</p>
